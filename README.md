# HusmanSTHLM
HusmanSTHLM - Website for a lunch restaurant featuring traditional Swedish cuisine

I used Bootstrap 5 at navigation bar to achieve a simpler responsive design. It is now fetched by a script and applied to all HTML pages, eliminating repetitive code for the navigation bar in each HTML file.

I have also implemented JavaScript for a popup menu on the menu page, allowing users to open the menu image for easier reading and a more aesthetically pleasing layout.

To adapt the project to various platforms, I utilize media queries.

I've organized the code in a way to make it easily readable and to assist others in understanding which part of the code corresponds to what.
